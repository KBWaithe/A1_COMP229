    <p>
        I grew up alongside technology, which has lead me down the path of not only appreciating technology and what it does for us as a tool but also how it helps us become more 
        creative and innovative as we get better at producing new technologies. I've naturally gone the route of the hardware aspect of technology, learning at a very early age
        the pros and cons of taking apart the TV remote (Sorry Dad!) and very quickly learning to document the steps you take in taking something apart so it's easy to put it back
        together in the future. Here and now at Centennial, I've had the opportunity to see the software side of technology, and I look forward to learning even more so that in the future
        I may be able to work with both mediums!
